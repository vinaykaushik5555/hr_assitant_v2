OK, so the recently I have completed that 201 training in which the agenda was to cover some Jan AI basics. So after the completion we have to implement our on use case which uses steam rate for UI Langda for agent.
Vinay Kumar 0 minutes 23 seconds
Agent and RAG use case and an MTP server and past API. So I have created a slide that I have implemented my use case as a HR assistant AI system.
Vinay Kumar 0 minutes 39 seconds
So what it has, So what what it tries to solve to it is a lot of fragmented information in multiple portals for employees and HR. Suppose you want to search the maternity policy. There is a different place and you want to apply for leaves. You have to go to the.
Vinay Kumar 0 minutes 59 seconds
Different portal and you want to apply for a transport TMS ticket. So you have to go to different portals and log into different portals and you have to follow the convention. So I have make it an agent which is HR AI assistant agent.
Vinay Kumar 1 minute 16 seconds
It is for both the target users are employees and and the HR admins. So what it can do it can it can search employees can search the policies on the portal itself. Employees can ask what is the casualty policy for for me.
Vinay Kumar 1 minute 36 seconds
And what is maternity policy? So the user can ask the queries similar to similar for the for the admins. They can update the policy so system supports multiple type of formats.
Vinay Kumar 1 minute 53 seconds
Which is a PDF MD file, HTML they can upload to portal and they can build the index vector index and users, employees or even HR can search on the based on the provided document. So that is part of that.
Vinay Kumar 2 minutes 12 seconds
Implementation. Apart from that I had built different tools which is which is exposed as a MCP server, MCP tool which allows like employee can apply for leaves by natural language, let's say user say.
Vinay Kumar 2 minutes 31 seconds
I won't leave from this date to this date and the reason is I am I am I am not well so that agent would determine that intent of the user like they it wants to apply for the leave and it would convert into the.
Vignesh S 51 minutes 2 seconds
All right, I'll pass on the feedback to Nitish, OK.

Vinay Kumar
51 minutes 6 seconds51:06
Vinay Kumar 51 minutes 6 seconds
So at the final I want to understand what improvement upon you say MCP client implementation is incorrect. That should not be that that should not be in this way another.

Vignesh S
51 minutes 18 seconds51:18
Vignesh S 51 minutes 18 seconds
Um.
Vignesh S 51 minutes 20 seconds
Yes, and.
Vignesh S 51 minutes 23 seconds
The land graph land graph minimum. It should be having the the nodes of 3-4 that should intelligently decide OK which needs to be called and it has to do some actions.

Vinay Kumar
51 minutes 24 seconds51:24
Vinay Kumar 51 minutes 24 seconds
And what? OK, language, OK.

Vignesh S
51 minutes 39 seconds51:39
Vignesh S 51 minutes 39 seconds
OK, never ever and never ever MCP MCP tools should not have any interaction with an alarm.

Vinay Kumar
51 minutes 39 seconds51:39
Vinay Kumar 51 minutes 39 seconds
Got it. So I'll note it down.

Vignesh S
51 minutes 50 seconds51:50
Vignesh S 51 minutes 50 seconds
That should purely based on some system record extraction or some of the API calls. That's it. That should not have any link to LLM.

Vinay Kumar
51 minutes 51 seconds51:51
Vinay Kumar 51 minutes 51 seconds
OK.
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 1 second
OK, got it.

Vignesh S
52 minutes 5 seconds52:05
Vignesh S 52 minutes 5 seconds
All right, and you should come up with a React framework enabled approach.

Vinay Kumar
52 minutes 5 seconds52:05
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 5 seconds
So.
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 11 seconds
So this is.
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 13 seconds
What do you mean by the act enabled approach?

Vignesh S
52 minutes 18 seconds52:18
Vignesh S 52 minutes 18 seconds
I think you should better study that it's our reasoning and actually.

Vinay Kumar
52 minutes 25 seconds52:25
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 25 seconds
OK, so things are actually the problem is that in the tools this is the January to 01 that most of the topics are mostly covered as a hello world application and some basics. So it would take time to read all about these things since I'm also working on.
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 43 seconds
Uh, client project. So yeah.

Vignesh S
52 minutes 44 seconds52:44
Vignesh S 52 minutes 44 seconds
Yeah, understood, Vinay. So yeah, things will takes time, but this is sorry, one second.
Vignesh S 52 minutes 54 seconds
Yeah, so things will take time. So this will be a iterative process. Maybe work on the feedback, then we'll further check OK, how it has been progressed, OK.

Vinay Kumar
52 minutes 57 seconds52:57
Vinay Kumar 52 minutes 57 seconds
Yeah.
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 1 second
Yeah, yeah, sure.

Vignesh S
53 minutes 8 seconds53:08
Vignesh S 53 minutes 8 seconds
I'll pass the feedback to Nitesh.

Vinay Kumar
53 minutes 9 seconds53:09
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 9 seconds
OK.
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 11 seconds
OK, so what finalize I would be say I would be need to work on MCP client, a client and the React framework you have mentioned.

Vignesh S
53 minutes 21 seconds53:21
Vignesh S 53 minutes 21 seconds
Uh, Langraf.

Vinay Kumar
53 minutes 23 seconds53:23
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 23 seconds
And then, yeah.

Vignesh S
53 minutes 26 seconds53:26
Vignesh S 53 minutes 26 seconds
And.
Vignesh S 53 minutes 31 seconds
And memory somewhere you have to add memory.
Vignesh S 53 minutes 37 seconds
Short term, long term memory.
Vignesh S 53 minutes 40 seconds
I haven't asked anything about the rack. I'll come to the rack bit details. Make sure that you have conceptual understanding for almost all the topics mentioned in this page, OK?

Vinay Kumar
53 minutes 41 seconds53:41
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 41 seconds
OK.
Vinay Kumar 53 minutes 53 seconds
OK.

Vignesh S
53 minutes 54 seconds53:54
Vignesh S 53 minutes 54 seconds
